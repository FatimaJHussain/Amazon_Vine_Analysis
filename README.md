# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
# Overview
We pick up one of the datasets from "Amazon Review Datasets" and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. We will use PySpark to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
